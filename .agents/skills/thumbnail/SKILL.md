name: thumbnail
description: Dedicated YouTube thumbnail generator — interviews you for exactly the style elements you want (environment, text budget, extras, accent color), then renders high-contrast, vibrant, face-consistent thumbnails with an explicitly selected image provider and verifies every frame before showing it. Use whenever you want to create, redo, or iterate thumbnail variants for a video — "make a thumbnail", "new version of B", "more realistic", "less text", "put the app on the screen", "another angle for the test". Renders into videos/<project>$packaging/thumbs/. Works standalone or as the render engine for Stage 5 of $packaging (which owns titles, bets, and descriptions).

## Current M4 provider workflow

Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/providers.md` and `docs/setup-macos.md`. Use the creative brief and composition guidance below while selecting an implemented provider explicitly.

- Local generation/reference editing: `.venv/bin/python -m tools.media image --prompt-file P/prompt.txt --out P/media/image.png [--ref P/reference-copy.png]`. The qualified profile is at most 768×512 pixels (or equal-area portrait dimensions), one reference, with true native resolution recorded. Do not label an upscale as native generation or silently downsize a requested reference. Use deterministic typography/compositing for the final packaging canvas.
- Bounded hybrid: prepare with `.venv/bin/python -m tools.codex_image_handoff prepare P --prompt-file P/prompt.txt --purpose thumbnail [--ref PATH]`. Obtain scoped user approval, reserve with `claim`, record a one-time dispatch with `begin REQUEST_JSON`, invoke the native Codex image tool once, and `import` its returned local artifact. If interrupted after `begin`, recover the existing output; do not blindly generate again. Never substitute a separate image API; record the tool's reported model or unknown.
- Preserve the one locked title × three genuinely different thumbnail bets workflow. Inspect spelling, requested resemblance, composition and small-preview legibility. A native call or personal likeness review is not required to close the synthetic first-release setup.
- Historical Gemini commands below are compatibility references. They require deliberate hosted selection and `--allow-cloud`; the absence of local capability does not authorize them. Large integrated image/identity workflows may be deferred under the first-release resource policy.


Read `AGENTS.md` and `docs/providers.md` first. Default to local media processing; hosted generation requires explicit approved scope. Check provider readiness before any generation command. Original provider examples below describe available compatibility paths, not permission to call them. Use project state and preserve prior approvals.


# YouTube Thumbnail Generator

Turns a thumbnail concept into **rendered, verified frames** — with the style built from an
**element menu you pick from**, not a fixed template. One number matters: **CTR**.

**Division of labor:** `$packaging` decides *what to bet on* (one fixed title, 3 distinct
thumbnail levers, honesty checks). This skill decides *what the frame looks like* and renders
it. Run standalone for iteration ("give me a new B"), or let packaging Stage 5 delegate here.
Both inherit two non-negotiables from packaging:

- **Honesty guardrail** — the frame must promise only what the video keeps.
- **Loud-vs-calm** — thumbnails are deliberately louder than `brand.md`. Never tone down to
  match the in-video brand.

## The baseline look (always on, never asked about)

Every render, regardless of selections: **high contrast** (deep darks OR clean brights, never
flat) · **vibrant saturated color** with one accent doing the work · **clear focal hierarchy**
(headline → hero object → face, three steps max) · **big high-energy positive face** from the
`media/library/faces/` kit · **premium, clickable finish** — crisp edges, no clutter · **every
text element perfectly spelled and razor sharp**.

These came from a real before/after CTR comparison (the "Image 13" guide, 2026-08): the flat,
low-contrast, no-hierarchy frame lost to the bold high-contrast hierarchical one ~4.4x on
views. The *axes* are always-on; the *decorations* below are strictly opt-in.

## The element menu (opt-in — this is what you ask about)

Exact prompt language for every element lives in `references/style-elements.md`. Summary:

| Element | What it is | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `single-hook` | ONE text element, huge (word or number) | the default; cleanest |
| `tiered-headline` | small white italic context line + huge green grunge power line | +1 text block |
| `sticker` | tilted yellow badge, black caps, red underline, arrow to the hero | +1; ≤2 short words or it garbles |
| `checkstrip` | slim bottom strip, 3 green-check benefits | +3 micro-texts; busy fast |
| `brush-tag` | brush-stroke tag at strip end (e.g. WITH CLAUDE) | +1 |
| `results-fan` | fan/burst of result cards from the hero (pure imagery, no lettering) | busy-frame risk |
| `glow-burst` | neon energy + particles radiating from the hero | cheap, usually worth it |
| `real-logo` | pass the actual logo file as a `--ref` so it renders faithfully | extra ref |
| `real-app-screen` | pass a real UI screenshot as a `--ref` for the on-screen app | extra ref; micro-text caveat |

**Environments** (pick one): `dark-studio` (neon-on-black, dramatic) · `real-office` (candid
DSLR look, anchored to the real room visible in the face refs) · `bright-graphic` (saturated
studio composite, the classic loud style).

## The flow

### 1 — Locate context
Project dir, existing `packaging/thumbs/` (what letters/versions exist), the locked title if
packaging ran (thumbnail text must never repeat it), face kit present (no kit → stop and ask,
see `media/library/faces/README.md`), `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env`.

### 2 — The interview (the point of this skill)
**Ask before generating** — one `AskUserQuestion` round. Skip any axis the user already
specified in their request; ask only what's still open.

1. **Environment** — dark-studio / real-office / bright-graphic.
2. **Text budget** — `single-hook` **(recommended default)** / `headline-plus-one` (tiered
   headline + at most ONE accent element) / `full-kit` (headline + sticker + checkstrip +
   tag — warn that it's the busy end; opt-in only).
3. **Extras** (multi-select) — glow-burst, results-fan, real-logo, real-app-screen, a
   prop/object, none.
4. **Accent color** — green (house default) / yellow / red / cyan.

**Calibration note (real creator feedback, 2026-08): the default is MINIMAL text.** The
full-kit look was tried and rejected as "too much text"; high contrast + vibrant were
explicitly kept. Never stack every element just because the guide contains them — each text
block after the first must earn its slot.

### 3 — Confirm the words
Echo the exact hook text (and sticker/strip words if selected) before rendering. Check
against the locked title: **thumbnail text never repeats title words** — the two combine
into one message.

### 4 — Build the prompt
Assemble from `references/style-elements.md` blocks: labeled brief (Reference roles → Subject
& Action → Composition & Hierarchy → Setting & Lighting → Text → Style), letter-by-letter
spelling for every rendered word, positive framing with the one earned negation (sub-images
carry no lettering/logos). Hardware rule: laptops/phones are "generic, plain dark bezel, no
logos or lettering on the hardware" — otherwise you get a MacBook.

### 5 — Render
```
.venv/bin/python tools/gen_thumbnail.py --prompt-file videos/<p>$packaging/thumbs/<X>.txt \
    --out videos/<p>$packaging/thumbs/<X>.png --jpg --seed <N>
```
- Default refs = the whole face kit. **Any explicit `--ref` replaces that default** — when
  passing a logo or app screenshot, re-include the face ref explicitly, and name each
  image's role in the prompt ("Image 1 = identity, Image 2 = the app").
- `real-app-screen` source: pull a frame from the project's baked preview with ffmpeg, crop
  to the window, save to `media/projects/<p>/` (reusable local path, ignored by Git) — never screenshot
  by hand if the beat already exists in the video.

### 6 — Verify (every render, before the user sees it)
Read the image back: hook spelled right + legible · face reads as the creator · one dominant
focal element · bright/saturated/positive expression · hands sane (count fingers, no phantom
limbs) · no stray lettering in sub-images · hardware unbranded · honesty (screen/props match
the real product) · 16:9, JPG <2MB. Fix-and-rerender before surfacing; flag anything
borderline honestly (e.g. micro-text garble in a real-app screen).

### 7 — Iterate
- **Letters are bets, numbers are dressings** (A, A2, D3…): a new *concept* gets a new
  letter; a restyle/refinement of the same lever bumps the number. One A/B/C test slot per
  letter family.
- Before overwriting `<X>.txt`/`.png`, preserve the old one as `<X>-v1.*`.
- Hold `--seed` to iterate composition-stable; change seed to explore. Change one thing at a
  time.
- Restitch the labeled contact sheet (`thumbs/_ABC-set.jpg`) after every accepted render so
  the set is always comparable at browse-wall scale.

## Failure modes → fixes (learned on real renders)

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Sticker/badge word garbled | ≤2 short words per badge, letters spelled out (L-I-F-E-T-I-M-E); re-render |
| Checkstrip drops a checkmark | phrase as "each item a green circular checkmark immediately followed by…" |
| MacBook bezel / brand on hardware | "generic slim laptop, plain dark bezel, no logos or lettering on the hardware" |
| Real app screen: micro-text garbles | expected — invisible at browse size; if it matters, blur-text reroll or perspective-warp the real screenshot in post |
| Face color cast (purple/green hand or skin) | name the light: "warm skin tones preserved; the screen adds only a faint cool glow" |
| Clone/double renders a stranger | "BOTH men in this image are this exact man" + give the double a distinct material (wireframe, hologram) |
| Office looks generic | anchor it: describe the real room visible in the face ref (wall color, plant) and say "match the real office behind him in Image 1" |
| Word spelled right but flat/pasted | grunge texture + soft outer glow + hard drop shadow, restate "razor sharp" |
